# rs-git-fsmonitor

A git fsmonitor hook written in Rust.

## Installation

The heavy lifting of this tool is handled by Facebook's `watchman` utilty, so you will need [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) installed.
The Homebrew and Habitat installers will handle installing this depencency for you, so you will only need to do this if you are building from source.

### Via Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the recommended way to install in Mac environments:

```bash
brew tap jgavris/rs-git-fsmonitor https://github.com/jgavris/rs-git-fsmonitor.git && brew install rs-git-fsmonitor

# Configure git repository to use the tool (run in desired large git repository):
git config core.fsmonitor rs-git-fsmonitor
```

### Via Habitat

[Habitat](https://habitat.sh) is the recommended way to install in Linux environments:

```bash
# Install and link packages
sudo hab pkg install --binlink --channel unstable jgavris/rs-git-fsmonitor

# Configure git repository to use the tool (run in desired large git repository):
git config core.fsmonitor rs-git-fsmonitor
```

## Purpose

Git 2.16 added support for a `core.fsmonitor` hook to allow an external tool to inform it which files have changed.

On repositories with many files, this can be a dramatic speedup.

```shell
λ find . -type f | wc -l
   30737
```

Before:

```shell
λ time git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit (use -u to show untracked files)

real	0m0.129s
user	0m0.062s
sys	0m0.268s
```

After:

```shell
λ time git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit (use -u to show untracked files)

real	0m0.067s
user	0m0.030s
sys	0m0.026s
```

## Uninstallation

```
git config --unset core.fsmonitor
```

And then you can remove it from the package manager you used to install it.
